# Capstone Project for Self Driving Cars


## Goals
In this project I complete various components of the Udacity ROS implementation for a self driving car, Carla.

There are four steps this project:
* Publish final waypoints to reflect a sequence of waypoints ahead of the car
* Complete a controller that generates throttle, brake, and steer commands
* Detect and report the status of the traffic lights
* Use traffic light information to generate a velocity profile for upcomming waypoints

My implementation closely follows the walkthrough tutorials. 

In an attempt to complete the optional part of the assignment, a database of camera images from the simulation is generated by saving incoming images in `tl_detector.py` (see commented section in line 174). The generated database is seperated into train and test sets and provided in `img` folder in the project repository. A python script is develped to load images, augment them, and train a neural network based on MobileNetV2 architecture to predict the red light status (see `train.py`). Since we only care if the light is red or not, the problem is formulated as a binary classification task. Unfortunately, the provided workspace does not include deep learning libraries such as keras or tensorflow and despite my efforts to install them on the workspace, I was not able to resolve the conflicts that happens due to the older and no longer supported versions of the software here. 

## Future imporvements

* Implement a object detection and light status classification method 
* Add logic for avoiding obstacles
